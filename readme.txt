DESCRIPTION:

Fahemni : is an e-learning platform that allows the sharing of knowledge and expertise via explanatory videos 
posted by students (especially but not only) for students of different levels of study, and also allowing
interactivity by the bias of comments, questions or proposed themes. It is a new concept of e-learning 
websites because it allows students to create their own content, and to let students teach other students, 
giving a horizontal approach to the teaching process. 
Fahemni has been created and is being developped by Faouzi BouzarAmrouche, a Computer Science master 
student in the Higher Engineering School of Computer Science in
Algiers. 

Contribution:
We are open to any suggestion or help to develop this project.
